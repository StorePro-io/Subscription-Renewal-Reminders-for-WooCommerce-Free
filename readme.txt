###Subscription Renewal Reminders for WooCommerce

<p><strong>To meet the new US Federal Trade Commission (FTC),  we have added a Click to Cancel option on the subscription reminder emails. You may use your preferred custom text on the button.</strong> </p>

Subscriptions Renewal Reminders allows you to send your subscribers a Renewal notifications by Emails X days before their subscription ends. This plugin only works with the WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin.

Subscription Renewal reminder emails are only sent to active subscribers. Emails will not be sent to customers whose subscription is On hold or Suspended.

Sending subscription renewal reminders is a great way to remind your customers abou the benefits of their subscription and encourage interaction with your product. Some juristrications may also require that send a reminder email before automatically charing a customer on a subscription. So install this plugin to make sure your customers have not forgotten their subscriptions and are aware of the upcoming charge.

The email reminder that the plugin sends to your WooCommerce Subscription customers is completely customisable by you. We have a Wysiwyg editor to cretate the perfect reminder email for your specific customer.

You can also decide when the reminder email is sent to your subscription customers. For example, 3 days before their subscription renews.

We also have a premium version of the plugin that has expanded functionality.

üîç <strong>How Our Plugin Differs from WooCommerce Subscription Core Renewal Notices</strong>

While WooCommerce core provides a basic renewal email system, Subscription Renewal Reminders for WooCommerce extends it with powerful customization, scheduling, and compliance features designed for real-world subscription management.

‚úÖ 1. Time-Based Scheduling (Advanced Control)
WooCommerce‚Äôs core renewal system only allows scheduling reminders a set number of days before renewal. <strong>Our plugin goes further ‚Äî letting you set both the number of days and the exact time</strong> renewal emails are sent. This added control ensures reminders reach customers at the most effective moment, improving engagement and predictability.

‚úÖ 2. Separate Admin & Customer Notifications
While WooCommerce core sends the same generic renewal notice, <strong>our plugin supports independent templates for customers and administrators.</strong> Each can have its own subject line, content, and design ‚Äî allowing you to communicate differently with your subscribers and your internal team.

‚úÖ 3. Admin CC Options
WooCommerce‚Äôs renewal system doesn‚Äôt allow sending a copy of renewal emails to store managers or staff. <strong>Our plugin introduces CC options</strong>, enabling you to send automatic copies of every renewal reminder to selected admin email addresses ‚Äî keeping your team fully informed of upcoming renewals.

‚úÖ 4. Customizable Email Templates
Unlike the limited default WooCommerce email styling, <strong>our plugin includes a built-in WYSIWYG editor</strong> that lets you create branded, visually engaging renewal reminders. Add text, images, links, and shortcodes to reflect your brand‚Äôs personality and tone ‚Äî providing a more professional communication experience.

‚úÖ 5. Click-to-Cancel Button (FTC Compliance)
WooCommerce renewal notices do not include a cancellation option. <strong>Our plugin adds a ‚ÄúCancel Subscription‚Äù button</strong> directly in the renewal reminder email, helping your store comply with <strong>FTC transparency and cancellation requirements.</strong> You can enable or disable the button and fully customize its text and styling.

‚úÖ 6. Multi-Interval Reminders
WooCommerce‚Äôs default reminder system sends only one notice per renewal. <strong>Our plugin lets you send multiple reminders</strong> ‚Äî for example, 14 days and 3 days before renewal ‚Äî giving you more opportunities to engage with subscribers and reduce unexpected cancellations.
